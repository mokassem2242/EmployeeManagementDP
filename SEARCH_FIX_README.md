# Search Functionality Fix

## Problem
The search functionality in `AdminEmployeeManagement.aspx` was not working for name, UAE ID, and email searches. The issue was in the database stored procedure `sp_Employee_Search` which was missing email search functionality.

## Solution
The following changes have been made to fix the search functionality:

### 1. Database Changes
- **File**: `Database/Scripts/06_FixSearchStoredProcedure.sql`
- **Change**: Updated the `sp_Employee_Search` stored procedure to include email search
- **Added**: Search by `WorkEmail` and `PersonalEmail` fields

### 2. Frontend Changes
- **File**: `AdminEmployeeManagement.aspx`
- **Change**: Re-enabled JavaScript debouncing for search functionality
- **Added**: Proper search loading indicators

### 3. Backend Changes
- **File**: `AdminEmployeeManagement.aspx.cs`
- **Change**: Added proper loading indicator management
- **Added**: Error handling for search operations

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Using the provided scripts
1. **Batch file**: Run `fix_search.bat` (Windows)
2. **PowerShell**: Run `fix_search.ps1` (Windows PowerShell)

### Option 2: Manual execution
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio
2. Connect to your database
3. Open and execute `Database/Scripts/06_FixSearchStoredProcedure.sql`

## What the Search Now Supports

The search functionality now supports searching by:

1. **Employee Name**
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Full Name (First + Last)

2. **Emirates ID**
   - Exact or partial matches

3. **Email Addresses**
   - Work Email
   - Personal Email

4. **Combined Filters**
   - Search term + Department filter
   - Search term + Status filter
   - All filters combined

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to `AdminEmployeeManagement.aspx`
2. In the search box, try searching by:
   - Employee name (e.g., "John", "Smith", "John Smith")
   - Emirates ID (e.g., "123456789")
   - Email address (e.g., "john@company.com")
3. Use the department and status dropdowns to further filter results
4. Click "Search" or let the auto-search trigger after typing

## Features

- **Auto-search**: Search triggers automatically after 500ms of no typing
- **Loading indicators**: Shows "Searching..." message during search operations
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages if search fails
- **Clear functionality**: "Clear" button resets all filters
- **Test search**: "Test Search" button for debugging

## Files Modified

1. `Database/Scripts/06_FixSearchStoredProcedure.sql` - Database fix
2. `AdminEmployeeManagement.aspx` - Frontend JavaScript
3. `AdminEmployeeManagement.aspx.cs` - Backend search handling
4. `fix_search.bat` - Windows batch script
5. `fix_search.ps1` - PowerShell script

## Notes

- The search is case-insensitive
- Partial matches are supported (e.g., "john" will find "John Smith")
- Empty search terms will return all employees
- The search works in combination with department and status filters
